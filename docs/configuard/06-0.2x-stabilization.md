# Configuard 0.2.x Stabilization Plan

This plan defines how we validate `0.2.x` quality before expanding scope in `0.3.x`.

## Goals

- Validate real-world behavior on multiple repositories.
- Prioritize reliability and predictable CI outcomes over new features.
- Capture actionable feedback with reproducible evidence.

## Pilot Scope

Run Configuard on at least 3 representative repositories:

1. appsettings-only repository
2. mixed appsettings + dotenv repository
3. repository using environment snapshots

For each repository:

- Run `validate` for at least two environments.
- Run `diff` between deployment-relevant environments.
- Run `explain` for at least three critical keys (including one alias-based key).

## Feedback Capture

Use the repository issue template:

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/stabilization-feedback.yml`

Record:

- command executed
- expected vs actual result
- exit code
- output format and verbosity used
- contract + source context (sanitized)

## Stability Gates

`0.2.x` is considered stable when all conditions are met:

1. No P0/P1 correctness bugs open for two consecutive weeks.
2. At least 3 pilot repositories complete with documented outcomes.
3. Release workflow publishes successfully for at least one patch release (`0.2.x`).
4. No unresolved ambiguity in source precedence and hard-failure semantics docs.

## Patch Release Policy (0.2.x)

- Patch releases (`0.2.1`, `0.2.2`, ...) are for:
  - bug fixes
  - reliability improvements
  - doc clarifications
- Avoid new command surface additions in `0.2.x` unless required for correctness.

## Exit Criteria for 0.3.0 Planning

Start `0.3.0` planning only after stabilization gates pass, then decide one focus:

- UX + diagnostics depth improvements, or
- experimental `discover` phase-2 entry point.
